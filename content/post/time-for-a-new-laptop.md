After over 8 years of use it is time to send my old MacBook Pro(2010) in pension. At time to have a look on the new notebooks on the market. After some month of research I have finial my new Desktop Setup and I go with Linux on the Desktop.

## New desktop setup 
My new laptop is a Thinkpad T480 with Debian running on it. 

There a some facts over the laptop:
* Intel i5 8250U (8 cores) 
* 16 GB of RAM
* 512 GB of NVME Storage
* Intel Graphics 620

## Why went away from apple 
First of all I like my Macbook Pro very much. I work percet all the years and is still quiet fast. But I have a lot of concerns about Apples decisions. There a a short list of the importens point. 
* To expensive (In Germany a Macbook Pro 15" start at around 2700€, my Thinkpad costs under 1300€. This gap is to huge even for a great laptop.)
* Keyboard Problem(I don't know how many decades why use keyboard. I can not understand how you can release such a crappy keyboard in 2018)
* No ESC key (Yes I use vim...)
* not really support from apple on the commandline. For near everything you need homebrew.
* No great package manager. (Mac AppStore, download from website, homebrew, no single way to install software.)
* No focus on the mac. (Apple spent most of their enery in the development of the iPhone and not to the mac) 

## Linux On the desktop
Of couse Linux on the desktop is at the start a lot of pain, but after the first setup I just runs really stable. 
I switch to linux on the desktop because of the following reasons:
* Good support for developing(all importend libaries packaged)
* stable OS

### Why Debian 
I try also Arch, Manjaro but at the end I stick with Debian, because Debian a total stable OS with nice community support. You will find documentation, HowTo for near everything in the internet. Also their is a large number of prebuild packages available. I like apt very much and think is one of the best package manager out their.
